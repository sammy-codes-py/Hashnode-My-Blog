# 5 Stacks Every Python Backend Web Developer Should Know

As a Python backend web developer, it is important to have a strong foundation in the language itself as well as familiarity with a variety of tools and technologies. In this blog post, we will outline some of the key stacks that a Python backend web developer should consider learning in order to be successful in their field.

1.  Python: As a Python backend web developer, it is essential to have a strong understanding of the language itself. This includes being familiar with Python's syntax, data types, and standard library. It is also important to have experience with common Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, as these are frequently used in web development projects.
    
2.  Web frameworks: There are several popular web frameworks written in Python, including Django, Flask, and Pyramid. These frameworks provide a structure for building web applications, and can greatly simplify the process of developing and deploying a web app. It is important for a Python backend web developer to be proficient in at least one of these frameworks.
    
3.  Databases: Most web applications require some kind of data storage, and there are many options available for Python developers. Relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite are commonly used, as are NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Cassandra. It is important for a Python backend web developer to be familiar with at least one type of database, and to know how to interact with it using Python.
    
4.  API development: A common task for backend web developers is building APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow different systems to communicate with each other. Python has several libraries and frameworks available for building APIs, including Django Rest Framework and FastAPI. It is important for a Python backend web developer to be familiar with these tools and know how to build and deploy APIs.
    
5.  Version control: Working with a team on a web development project requires a way to track changes and collaborate with others. Git is a popular version control system that allows developers to manage code changes and collaborate with their team. It is important for a Python backend web developer to be familiar with Git and know how to use it to track changes to their codebase.
    

There are many other tools and technologies that a Python backend web developer should be familiar with, such as web servers, deployment tools, and testing frameworks. However, the stacks outlined above provide a strong foundation for any Python backend web developer looking to build and deploy web applications.
